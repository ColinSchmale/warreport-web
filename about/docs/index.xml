&lt;h2>Why are there no Legend League stats for my account?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="why-are-there-no-legend-league-stats-for-my-account">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#why-are-there-no-legend-league-stats-for-my-account" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The Legend League data is provided by the ClashKing Discord bot, which manages a large database with most of the players in the Legend League. However, it may happen that a player is not yet known to ClashKing. To add a player to this database, please use the command &amp;lsquo;/legends search&amp;rsquo; in the chat of my &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/pEDjJgy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord server&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The war tab displays ongoing clan wars of your bookmarked players and clans. Use the filter in the top right corner if you only want to see specific war types. You can also remove clans or players for which you don’t want to see ongoing wars. If you have many bookmarks, loading the list may take longer, so use the filter to select the wars you are interested in. As soon as a player or clan is at war, you will also find a button at the bottom of the player or clan page that will take you to the clan war page.&lt;/p>
